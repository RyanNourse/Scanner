# Scanner
This is a school project where the goal was to create our own version of how a scanner functions. 
This code will take in a test file and read in all character of the file and assign them to the type dynamically. 

There will be 23 tokens that is searched for in the file and if that token is found the code will assign that token to the correct char, value, or method.
Tokens:
ERROR, ENDOFFILE, LBRACE, RBRACE, EQUALASSIGN, EE, STRING, SEMI, LPAREN, RPAREN, GRE, GR, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, PLUS, MINUS, MOD, COMMA, AND, OR, NOT, FLOAT,NONE

There is a file called "example.txt" that will have the test case used
